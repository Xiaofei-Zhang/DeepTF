## Introduction
The advancement in Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) provides a new approach to understand metabolic reprogramming in cancer. Our work concerns the discovery of transcription factors that govern the alterations of enzymes involved in metabolic reprogramming. Changing the activity levels of transcription factors is one of the principal mechanisms through which cells differentiate and respond to changes in external signals or conditions. In this work, we present a deep learning-based method, named DeepTF, which predicts sample-specific transcription factors that regulate the target genes of interest. We demonstrate (i) DeepTF significantly outperforms the winner of DREAM5 Network Inference Challenge in recovering genetic regulatory networks, and (ii) DeepTF shows high accuracy for uncovering de novo the dysregulatory network that may underlie the differential toxic action of selenite on non-small cell lung cancer cells.
